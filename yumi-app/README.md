The application/simulation to control YuMi is based on a proprietary backend that is written at Computational Robotics Lab (CRL), ETH Zurich. Therefore, we can not share the complete simulation code (shared snippet here is missing 95% of the code and all the external libraries to actually run). 

Here, we would like to provide a rough idea about only the communication interface for interested people.
